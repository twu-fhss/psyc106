# Therapy- Part 1

## Overview {-}

Units 11 and 12 introduce the exciting, and ever expanding, world of therapy. Today, psychotherapeutic techniques are used to address a range of human conditions- from helping people find hope in overwhelmingly challenging circumstances to people exploring ways to optimize their potentials. Having a therapeutic relationship can be tremendously valuable in a person’s life as a therapist should be non-judgmental and have no other agenda than to help a person reach their therapeutic goals. The focus of this unit will be to provide some overview and perspectives on therapy.

## Therapies- Part 1

### Psychological Therapies {-}

Psychological therapies, or psychotherapies, are a general class of therapies that deal with the psychological (mental/behavioural) world of people with disorders.

These therapies are generally contrasted with biomedical approaches, which deal more with the biological world of the individual. Biomedical therapies focus on altering a person's biology to effect a change in the person's psychology.

### Eclectic Approach {-}

The eclectic approach is an approach that values the diversity of treatment approaches. Eclectic approaches deal with psychology and biology. In addition, various types of psychotherapies may be employed. Eclectic therapy approaches are becoming very popular.

### A Sin Problem? {-}

*“Many Christians are not satisfied with viewing psychological disorders as either illnesses or nothing but thought and behavior problems. They feel that both of these approaches are inadequate because they omit very important moral and spiritual questions. Consequently, the important issue of moral responsibility is not dealt with adequately.

They feel that since humanity's most basic problem is alienation from God as a result of sin, no other difficulty can be dealt with until the relationship with God has been restored. Thus the first goal of therapy is to bring the client to the place of acknowledging his or her need, and asking for divine forgiveness through Jesus Christ. Once the client has placed his or her trust in God, and is operating within the same religious conceptual framework as the therapist, therapy can then proceed to the identification of specific disturbances of thought and behavior. These are seen as examples of sin in that the individual is either acting in a sinful way towards others, or is harboring sinful thoughts and attitudes within. The therapist will assist the individual to identify, confess, and forsake these sins. The goal of therapy is seen primarily in terms of spiritual growth and a "closer walk with God."*

### Sin Only? {-}

In a work for Christian counselors, Koteskey (1983) gives the example of his eighteen month old son who developed an intense fear of dogs after two unpleasant experiences with them. Even the fact that the child was too young to talk did not prevent a fellow Christian psychologist from concluding that he had a spiritual problem. We should recognize that not every problem is necessarily a spiritual one. Just as a disturbance may have a purely biological cause, so too it may have a simple psychological (learning) explanation. Information gained from the study of animals may be helpful in the understanding of psychological problems as it is often vital in understanding biological problems. *(Both excerpts from Psychology and Christianity by Ronald Philipchalk)*

### Activity: Read and Reflect {-}

```{block2, type='reflect'}

For many people unfamiliar with the journey of counselling, finding suitable resources may feel daunting. It is important to know that there are many different approaches designed to help you accomplish the growth goals you have for your life. In this activity, the first resource, Psych Central is the oldest peer-reviewed psychology and mental health network on the Internet. Established in 1992, originally it was an index to mental health. Now it gives you the opportunity to see some treatment options for a wide variety of conditions. Additionally, there is a resource on different theoretical approaches to behavior change, and a link to some information concerning the integration of Christianity and psychotherapy.

- ***What is your view of the role of sin (or questionable moral behaviours) or other religious/spiritual beliefs in the treatment of psychological disorders?***  
- ***What kinds of religious/spiritual beliefs could lead to greater feelings of guilt/shame and increased psychological disorder?*** 

*Be prepared to share your thoughts with other members of the class.*
